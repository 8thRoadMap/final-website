	<h2>  8th Road Map </h2>
	
	<p>
	The 8th Road Map website is a platform created by eight ABM students to present a clear and organized synthesis of the 8th Research Congress. It guides viewers through the key findings, insights, and lessons shared during the event, while connecting them to real-life applications and academic understanding. The website also highlights our mission and vision, the background and purpose of the project, and each member’s contributions, all curated with accuracy, clarity, and academic integrity.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The website is designed to be user-friendly and professional, providing an accessible resource for multiple audiences. These include fellow ABM and senior high students who are interested in research and its applications, teachers and academic advisers who may use the synthesis for learning, researchers and participants of the congress seeking a structured summary, and general audiences who wish to explore sustainable urban development, policy planning, and evidence-based insights. By consolidating this knowledge into one platform, 8th Road Map demonstrates our teamwork, organization, and commitment to academic excellence.

	<h2>  Background of the Project </h2>
	
	<p>
	Our group selected the name “8th Road Map” for two meaningful reasons.
 First, our main content focuses on the 8th Research Congress, which served as the foundation for our synthesis.
 Second, our team consists of eight members, each contributing essential roles to complete the project.

	</p>
	
	<p>
	The term “Road Map” symbolizes our website as a guide—a clear route that leads viewers through the information, analysis, and understanding we aim to deliver. Just like a roadmap, this website is designed to be straightforward, informative, and easy to follow.

	<h2>  Vision </h2>
	
	
	<p>
	To be a leading online platform, the 8th Road Map website aims to share research in a way that is easy to understand, widely accessible, and inspiring for students, teachers, and future researchers. The project seeks to create a space that connects academic learning with creativity, allowing users to explore, understand, and apply new knowledge about sustainable urban development and informed decision-making. With clarity, innovation, and collaboration as its focus, the website is envisioned to do more than just provide information; it strives to spark interest, support learning, and help build a strong research culture within and beyond the community.
